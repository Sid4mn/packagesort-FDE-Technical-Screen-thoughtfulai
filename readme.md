Hi,

Thanks for this quick tech screen, I had previously hosted this on replit, but unfortunately ran out of free resources.

##Files
- **`main.py`**  
  Contains the `sort` function with input validation and classification logic.
  
- **`test.py`**  
  Contains `pytest`-based tests to ensure that `sort` handles valid/invalid inputs correctly.

Please clone this repo, and cd into it.
install dependencies : pip install pytest
run the tests: pytest
